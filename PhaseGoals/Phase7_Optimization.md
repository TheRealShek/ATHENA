# Phase 7: Optimization & Stability

**Goal:** Make system performant and reliable under real-world conditions.

## 7.1 Performance Optimizations
- Operation batching
- Document compression
- Memory management

## 7.2 Network Resilience
- Reconnection logic
- Operation replay
- Conflict detection

## 7.3 Error Handling
- Client-side: invalid format, server rejection, connection loss
- Server-side: malformed ops, version mismatch, resource limits

## 7.4 Rate Limiting
- Per-connection: ops/sec, message size, idle timeout
- Per-session: document size, file count, user count

## 7.5 Monitoring & Debugging
- Metrics: sessions, ops/sec, latency, memory, errors
- Logging: structured logs, operation history, audit trail
- Debug mode: visualize transforms, show versions, network stats

## Deliverables
- Handles 10+ concurrent users smoothly
- Reconnects automatically after network issues
- Operations batched for efficiency
- Graceful degradation under load
- Monitoring dashboard with key metrics
